## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Javascript](https://devdocs.io/javascript/) - Core Javascript
<!-- - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

-I got a better understaning of how to work with and manipulate html elements as well as css properties
But still need more practice to be come more confident using javascript
-Learnt how to use google fonts in my projects

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
input[type="Radio"]:checked + label{ 
}; 
  /* Finally how to style input fields in css */
```
```js
document.getElementsByClassName("btn")[0].addEventListener("click", function() {
}); //This was amazing thing i learnt its shot and more effective approach
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

After this project i still need to put more focus on how to:
-[Js - DOM]: get to know the hierachy well (child and parent nodes)
             how to handle with documents which have multiple elements of the same name
             different ways of going about functions
             more ways of writing clean effective code
-[Css - flexbox and Grid]: Need to improve my layout skills
                           Learning Grid layout will also help

### Useful resources

- [Css - Radio button Editing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4920281/how-to-change-the-size-of-the-radio-button-using-css) - This helped me to understand different ways to eidt and style radio input button (used it for resizing).
- [Js - Event handling ](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp) - This page was very helpful when it came to DOM manipulation particulary event listening . I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
